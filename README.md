# [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/)

Commander Spellbook is a combo database, wiki and engine for [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en).
It's designed to be a one-stop shop for all the information you might want about a combo, whether it's a deck you're
building or one you're playing against.

This is an Open Source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to contribute, please
read the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Architecture

Commander Spellbook consists of three main components:

- A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database containing all the combo data
- A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) [backend](/backend/) that exposes the data via a REST API
- A [React](https://reactjs.org/) [frontend](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-site) that consumes the API and displays the content in a user-friendly way
  - A TS/JS generated client can be found on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@space-cow-media/spellbook-client)
