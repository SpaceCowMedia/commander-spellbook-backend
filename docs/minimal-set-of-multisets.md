# The Minimal Set of Multisets Abstract Data Type

## Introduction

The Minimal Set of Multisets (MSM) is a data structure that represents a set of multisets.
No multiset in a MSM is a subset of another multiset in the MSM.
When you add a new multiset to a MSM, one of two things happens:

1. If the new multiset is a superset of an existing multiset, nothing happens and the MSM remains unchanged.
2. Otherwise, if the new multiset is not a superset of any existing multiset, it is added to the MSM.
   Then, any multiset that is a superset of the added multiset is removed from the MSM.


## Example

Suppose we have a MSM with the following multisets:

```
{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2}
{1: 1, 2: 2, 4: 1}
{1: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1}
```

If we add the multiset `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1}`, nothing happens and the MSM remains unchanged, because the new multiset is a superset of the second multiset.

If we add the multiset `{1: 1, 2: 1, 6: 1}`, it is added to the MSM:

```
{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2}
{1: 1, 2: 2, 4: 1}
{1: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1}
{1: 1, 2: 1, 6: 1}
```

If we add the multiset `{1: 1, 2: 2}`, it is added to the MSM, and all its supersets are removed:

```
{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2}
{1: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1}
{1: 1, 2: 1, 6: 1}
{1: 1, 2: 2}
```

If we add the multiset `{1: 1, 2: 1}`, it is added to the MSM, and all its supersets are removed:

```
{1: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1}
{1: 1, 2: 1}
```

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the MSM in the [minimal_set_of_multisets.py](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend/blob/master/backend/spellbook/variants/minimal_set_of_multisets.py) file.

## Considerations

PyPy works way better with simple Python code than with over-engineered data structures, so the currently fastest implementation of the MSM is the naive one, which uses a Python set to store the multisets and checks for supersets/subsets using simple loops.
